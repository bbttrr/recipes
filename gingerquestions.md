Why make ginger cookies and not ginger bread?
Why make 15 and not 20?
Why ginger and not chocolate chip?

I am posing these questions from the questions branch, locally.

## This post is being developed in a separate branch

Yes. Excellent.

## Method

1. I am going to add and commit this additional change.
2. Take a look.
3. Transfer the cookies to a tray and bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Lightly dust the cookies with icing sugar.
